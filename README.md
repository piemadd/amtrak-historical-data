Historical tracking data for Amtrak trains

Data is saved in the [`outputs`](https://github.com/piemadd/amtrak-historical-data/tree/main/outputs) folder once per minute in the format `[Unix-Timestanp].json` Saving it here happpened to be the cleanest scenario I could think of, and also made it widely available.

Source code is running [here](https://replit.com/@piemadd/train-data-over-a-week).
